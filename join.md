## How can I join the RECON community?

There are two ways to join our community, corresponding to different degrees of
involvement:

- as a *subscriber* following our activities, by signing up to our 
[mailing list](https://mailman.ic.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/recon-forum) 
and getting involved in discussions on our
[Slack organisation](https://reconhub.slack.com)

- as a *member*, who actively contributes to the development of analytics
  resources for RECON's areas of interest; this is typically more involved but
  also offers advantages reserved to members; see the *Becoming a member*
  section below
