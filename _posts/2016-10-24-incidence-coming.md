*incidence* is the first of RECON's new line of packages for outbreak response. It is still getting its final polish, but its features are already available and documented. In a nutshell, *incidence* is:

- a toolkit for computing, handling, and plotting incidence
- a set of functions for fitting log-linear models to incidence data
- a tool for detecting the peak of an outbreak based on log-linear model fitting
- a tool for computing doubling or halving times using log-linear models
- a package including 3 vignettes: an overview of features (*overview*), tips for customizing plots (*customize-plot*) and details of the `incidence` class (*incidence-class*)
- a thoroughly-tested set of functions (code coverage by unit tests: [100%](http://codecov.io/github/reconhub/incidence?branch=master))
