Our website has been growing over the last days! It now contains several sections including:

- a new page to [join](../join) the consortium, relying on a simple Google form; a simple script will permit semi-automatic updates of the list of members
- a new page about the [members](../people), updated daily
- a new page about [projects](../projects)
- a [forum](../forum) hosted by *Vanillaforums*, dedicated to discussions relating to outbreak analysis and R


We now have the basic infrastructure to grow. It is official: **the RECON website is live!**
