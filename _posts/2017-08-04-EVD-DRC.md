## A new Ebola outbreak in DRC

RECON members Jonathan Polonsky (WHO) and Thibaut Jombart (Imperial College
London) joined the WHO response team for an [Ebola Virus Disease (EVD)
outbreak](http://www.afro.who.int/news/ebola-virus-disease-democratic-republic-congo)
which took place in DRC in May-July 2017. This deployment took place as part of
the activation of the [Global Alert and Response Network
(GOARN)](http://www.who.int/ihr/alert_and_response/outbreak-network/en/).  The
outbreak was successfully contained after 8 EVD cases, including 4 fatalities,
were reported in the Likati health zone, [Bas Uele
province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bas-Uele).  The end of the outbreak was
[officially
declared](http://www.afro.who.int/news/who-declares-end-ebola-outbreak-democratic-republic-congo)
by WHO on the 2nd July 2017, 42 days (i.e. 2x95th percentile of the incubation
period) after the last confirmed case.

## RECON tools informed the response

A number of packages were used for improving situation awareness during this
outbreak. [*epicontacts*](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/epicontacts/) was
used for visualising and analysing contact tracing
data. [*incidence*](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/incidence/) and
[*epitrix*](https://github.com/reconhub/epitrix) were used in combination with 2
newly developed packages,
[*earlyR*](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/earlyR/) and
[*projections*](https://github.com/reconhub/projections), to estimate the
disease's transmissibility and the associated uncertainty, and predict plausible
epidemic courses. These predictions were used in real time for informing the
response, showing that current efforts were sufficient for containing the
outbreak, permitting to scale further efforts accordingly. These analyses are
mentioned in the publicly available WHO [situation
reports](http://www.afro.who.int/health-topics/ebola-virus-disease) such as
[this
one](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/255615/1/EbolaDRC-01062017.pdf).
