This week (2019-W24-2), the [*aweek* package](../aweek) version 1.0.0
has been [released on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=aweek).

The *aweek* package is a response to the lack of utilities to easily
define weeks that do not start on Monday, which is necessary for
outbreak response in [countries whose calendars may start on Sunday or
Saturday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:First_Day_of_Week_World_Map.svg).
This package provides utilities to convert dates to weeks and back again
with any week start definition.

You can install *aweek* with:

``` r
install.packages("aweek")
```

Using aweek is straightforward. When you load the package, you can set
the day on which all weeks should start with `set_week_start()`.

``` r
library("aweek")
# At the beginning of your analysis, set the week start to the weeks you want
# to use for reporting
ow <- set_week_start("Sunday")
d  <- as.Date("2019-06-11")
(w <- as.aweek(d)) # convert dates to weeks
```

    ## <aweek start: Sunday>
    ## [1] "2019-W24-3"

``` r
as.Date(w)         # convert weeks to dates
```

    ## [1] "2019-06-11"

All aweek objects carry a `week_start` attribute, which is the ISO week
day that defines the start of the week for that object.

One of the common things you might want to do is to define a range of
dates to use to filter linelist data. You can use `get_date()` to get a
date from week numbers. Note that day in this context refers to the day
of the week relative to the week start, so a “7” is “Saturday”.

``` r
library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")
linelist   <- as_tibble(outbreaks::ebola_sim_clean$linelist)
linelist
```

You can use aweek to aggregate weekly data. The default aweek object is
in the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-Www-d) and `factor_aweek()` can remove the
`-d` portion, giving weekly aggregates, which will include any missing
weeks in the levels:

``` r
ll_obs %>%
  mutate(week = as.aweek(date_of_onset)) %>%
  mutate(aggregate_week = factor_aweek(week)) %>%
  count(aggregate_week, gender, .drop = FALSE) %>%
  spread(gender, n)
```

    ##    aggregate_week     f     m
    ##    <fct>          <int> <int>
