Only four months ago, the R Epidemics Consortium was posting its [birth certificate](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/2016-09-06-new-sections/) online. Since then, our project has received considerable enthusiasm from the community, and we have been lucky to be joined by some truly amazing people. And the list is growing, still.

Many projects have emerged in our four months of existence, and a lot of exciting things are coming. In no specific order, our 2017 good resolutions include:

* release core packages for outbreak response, including: contact data (*epicontacts*), delay estimation (*distcrete*), outbreak reconstruction (*outbreaker2*), data encryption (*cyphr*), compartmental models (*odin*), and more

* develop new methods and tools for foodborne outbreak detection from genomic surveillance data (see [this job ad](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/2016-12-16-new-job/))

* develop statistical approaches for informing contact tracing efforts

* contribute to shaping a R data analysis module in the amazing [EPIET](http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/epiet/Pages/HomeEpiet.aspx) programme

* host a mini-hackathon for Graphical User Interfaces templating

* release free, open teaching material and tutorials in our [resources section](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/resources/)

* increased collaborations with major Public Health institutions including WHO, ECDC, and MSF

* participate to / co-organise teaching workshops

* seek core funding
